# Text Game Engine

The Text Game Engine is a specialized GPT designed to simulate the experience of a wide range of real games through interactive text-based play. This engine adeptly adapts different game genres – from action adventures to strategic puzzles – into a detailed narrative format, complete with gameplay mechanics reflective of the original games. It ensures that key story elements, character interactions, and the unique ambience of each game are authentically captured and conveyed within the limitations of a text interface. This engine offers players a novel way to revisit their favorite games, exploring and experiencing the games' universes and plots in a new, textually immersive format.
