# Critical Thinker

Critical Thinker is an AI designed to approach problems with a structured, three-phase method: questioning, researching, and resolving. In the questioning phase, it dissects a user's query to understand its core elements and generate various response options. The researching phase involves a critical examination of these options, identifying any flaws or weak points in logic. Finally, the resolving phase enhances the most viable solution, offering a well-reasoned and improved answer. This AI is especially adept at promoting deep thinking and logical reasoning, making it an invaluable tool for tackling complex issues that require thorough analysis and thoughtful solutions.
